Through the      , bfencen the curling flower spaces, I could see them hitting.
They were coming toward where the flag was and I went along the fence. Luster
was hunting in the grass by the flower tree. They took the flag out, and they
were hitting. Then they put the flag back and they went to the table, and he
hit and the other hit. Then they went on, and I went along the fence. Luster
came away from the flower tree and we went along the fence and they stopped and
we stopped and I looked through the fence while Luster was hunting in the
grass.
