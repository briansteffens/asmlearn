The db file format is made up of a header (record count) followed by that
number of records.

Example:

Offset 0, bytes 4 - RECORD_COUNT

    The total number of records in the file

Offset 4, bytes 32 - RECORD 0, FIRST_NAME

    The first name field for the first record

Offset 36, bytes 32 - RECORD 0, LAST_NAME

    The last name field for the first record

Offset 68, bytes 4 - RECORD 0, AGE

    The age field for the first record

Each record is 68 bytes.

Each record starts at offset ((RECORD_INDEX - 1) * 68) + 4
